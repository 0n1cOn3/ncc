# ![NCC](assets/icon/ncc_32px.png "NCC")   NCC

Nosial Code Compiler is a program written in PHP designed to be a multi-purpose compiler, package manager and toolkit.

## Notes

 > While NCC has windows compatibility in mind, not all compiler extensions or features will work correctly. NCC is
 > designed to be used in production in a Unix environment and Windows should only be used for development purposes.

 > Compiler extensions requires their own set of dependencies to be met, for example Java compilers will require JDK

 > NCC is designed to run only on a PHP 8.0+ environment, compiler extensions can have support for different PHP versions.

 > Third-party dependencies and included libraries has a dedicated namespace for `ncc` to avoid user land conflicts if
 > the user wishes to install and use one of the same dependencies that NCC uses.
