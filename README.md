Nosial Code Compiler is a program written in PHP designed to be a multi-purpose compiler, package manager and toolkit.
This program is a complete re-write of the now defunct [PHP Package Manager (PPM)](https://git.n64.cc/intellivoid/ppm)
toolkit offering more features, security and proper code licensing and copyrighting for the components used for the project.
